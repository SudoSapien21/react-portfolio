          Welcome to my portfolio; as you navigate the file, you will understand who I AM and whose I AM. As time passes,
         I will continue to add more content to this site, giving more in-depth information about me and the projects I have been working on. "...We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, 
         who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you..." Nelson Mandela</p>
