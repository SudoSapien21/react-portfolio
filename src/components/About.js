    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
      <p>I was born and raised on the Southside of Chicago. When I graduated from High School, I decided to attend college, where I received my bachelor's degree in business. 
      I also received an associate's degree in Computer Science and a certificate in PC technician. I am working on my Real Estate License while trying to maintain a coding 
      certificate.</p>
